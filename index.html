          In the past 60 years, the US has seen a reduction of poverty by approximately 53%, according to the US Census Bureau’s report on Income and Poverty in the United States: 2019. While the numbers are promising, the upward trend is not reflective of the entire US population and doesn’t take into consideration how the nature of employment is changing and how that will impact workers’ ability to save adequately for retirement.

         This video discusses the implications of how the gig economy may have a negative impact on retirement saving. Larry Atkins president of the National Academy of Social Insurance addresses a potential solution. While Joani Plenty shares her concerns about finding herself unprepared financially. Elizabeth Santos explains the importance of updating financial literacy education to match the changing job landscape.

          The economy is indeed changing. Some of the largest companies that have seen exponential growth have been those that support the gig economy. Whether it’s Upworks, a platform that allows you to hire freelancers or Uber, the way they hire will forever change the nature of employment.

          These employment structures have become popular amongst Americans because getting a job is easier than trying to land a traditional position. The downside is that these gig jobs don’t currently offer access to tax-advantage retirement accounts.

         Mohamed Chawli is a husband and father of 3. His only source of income is short-term contract work that he does online. He’s a marketing expert that gets paid on a 1099. At the age of 34, he doesn’t have a dedicated retirement account and has never had access to a 401(K). The only money he has set aside is for an emergency fund. Chawli is not alone. About 71% of Milennials and Bommers have saved up less than $50,000.

         “I haven’t saved enough. As someone self-employed and living in an expensive city like NYC, things are usually uncertain. Basically, you are on your own. I often use my savings to cover unprecedented expenses, which puts me under a tremendous amount of pressure and leads to insecurity,” Chawli said.

       One surprising statistic is that the majority of those who are engaged in short-term work are not from the private sector. Instead, they work government jobs, which means many jobs that in the past would have been accompanied by a pension plan have been replaced with jobs that are not guaranteed long term and don’t have any type of employment’ sponsored retirement contributions account.

          March’s jobless claims tells a different story. With the recent
          release of new data, the numbers skyrocket to a record breaking 3.283
          million claims. The data released Thursday morning may be the earliest
          indicator that the economy is beginning to take a hit on jobs. While
          the hospitality sector was hit the hardest, manufacturing jobs may
          soon follow suit as the impact ripples through the economy.
