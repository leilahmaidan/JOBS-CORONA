          In the past 60 years, the US has seen a reduction of poverty by approximately 53%, according to the US Census Bureau’s report on Income and Poverty in the United States: 2019. While the numbers are promising, the upward trend is not reflective of the entire US population and doesn’t take into consideration how the nature of employment is changing and how that will impact workers’ ability to save adequately for retirement.

         This video discusses the implications of how the gig economy may have a negative impact on retirement saving. Larry Atkins president of the National Academy of Social Insurance addresses a potential solution. While Joani Plenty shares her concerns about finding herself unprepared financially. Elizabeth Santos explains the importance of updating financial literacy education to match the changing job landscape.

          Companies like Uber, Lyft, and Door Dash have become popular amongst both young and older Americans because getting a job is easier than trying to land a traditional position. But these companies don’t currently offer access to tax-advantage retirement accounts. Nor do they pay a steady income or provide unemployment in the event a worker lost their job. .

         Mohamed Chawli is a husband and father of 3. His only source of income is short-term contract work that he does online. He’s a marketing expert that gets paid on a 1099. At the age of 34, he doesn’t have a dedicated retirement account and has never had access to a 401(K). The only money he has set aside is for an emergency fund. Chawli is not alone. About 71% of Milennials and Bommers have saved up less than $50,000.

          Tony Bennett, president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers,
          said the trade wars that took over 2019 had a harder impact on
          manufacturers but a positive long term effect that is now being
          witnessed during COVID-19. According to Bennett, the increased tariffs
          unexpectedly helped prepare many Texas manufacturers by forcing them
          to reroute logistics components from countries other than China to
          places like Vietnam, India and Mexico.

          “Companies are well stocked so we haven’t seen large indications of
          supply chain issues. More supply chain issues may happen in another
          month or so when companies start to work through their supply chain
          inventories,” Said Jay Bryson, economist at Wells Fargo.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Yet, since the virus has spread globally, many countries are beginning
          to suffer the same fate as China. While diversifying the supply chain
          helped some manufacturers alleviate earlier impacts, they are
          beginning to see trouble on the demand side.

          “You may see [workers] shifts going down, like one shift out of two or
          three a day. You see a slow down and then if things get really bad, we
          may see a shutdown. I haven’t seen shifts going down yet, but that is
          usually the way it happens,” said Bennet. The below graph indicates
          that worker's shifts have not yet begun to see decreases. The
          increased overtime hours are likely a reflection of a positive
          forecast after a trade truce was reached between the US and China and
          before the virus was a global threat.

          March’s jobless claims tells a different story. With the recent
          release of new data, the numbers skyrocket to a record breaking 3.283
          million claims. The data released Thursday morning may be the earliest
          indicator that the economy is beginning to take a hit on jobs. While
          the hospitality sector was hit the hardest, manufacturing jobs may
          soon follow suit as the impact ripples through the economy.

          “People are going to fear they can’t make car payments,” said Bennett.
          manufacturers of durable goods are feeling the most impact. Products
          that require significant long-term investment such as automotive or
          capital goods, are going to slow down during a recession.

          From the demand side, one of the hardest hit industries is oil and
          gas. The commodity’s drop in price is impacting manufacturers that
          service oil fields. Companies that make trailers, rigs, steel and
          metal fabrications, fracking rigs are slowing down rapidly. Bennett
          said the state is two to three weeks away from significant
          unemployment figures and claims to the Texas Workforce Commission and
          local unemployment offices. “For manufacturers, the closer they are to
          oil and gas, the more misfortune will be in store for them,” he said.

          From the supply side, Qais Alkurdi, owner of SirCom, an American
          manufacturer of early warning systems, is three weeks behind on
          inventory deliveries. Approximately 70% of products that were supposed
          to arrive from Germany in the last week of February and first week of
          March, never came. The company still has no expected delivery date.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “Our supply chain has been disrupted in every possible scenario,
          including from shipping and deliveries. The UPS and DHLs of the world
          are acting similar to how you see them around Christmas time, they are
          doing what they can but being pushed and pulled in every direction.
          The delays are bad and there is no communication from our logistics
          partners. We expect deliveries one day, we get them the next,” said
          Alkurdi.
        </p>

        <p class="g-copy">
          SirCom, which assembles a majority of its product in Germany and the
          U.S., is experiencing disruption because it relies on key raw
          materials from China. The delays mean they will not reach their 2020
          projected profits, even with a recovery in the next 2-3 weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The company attempted to mitigate inventory gaps by seeking raw
          materials from other countries but were only successful in
          substituting 30% of the materials that came from China. With demand
          also coming from other manufacturers seeking alternatives, there was
          not enough supply.

          Key materials required for lithium batteries and printed circuit
          boards, such as electronic circuitry, resistors and capacitors, were
          not easy to replace.

        <p class="g-copy">
          “We haven't yet been in a situation where we failed to meet [client]
          demand but we are at high risk, there is about a 65% chance we will
          not make our mid-April deadlines,” said Alkurdi.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          For Alkurdi’s company, if supply chain issues continued into
          mid-April, the outcome would be catastrophic. Large projects that had
          been awarded to them would fail to meet their dates and the impact
          would eventually be felt in jobs.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Not all manufacturers are facing the same fate. Some are beating the
          odds and even thriving while adding new jobs. “When you go to the
          grocery store and see the empty shelves, those are the manufacturers
          doing well,'' said Bennett. Manufacturers for food, beverage, paper
          products, personal hygiene and protective gear can't keep up with
          demand.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Duggal Solutions, a printing company out of New York, was able to
          shift its manufacturing line to output 20 thousand personal protective
          gear a day for healthcare workers, something they had never
          manufactured before. The company’s manufacturing line works heavily
          with paper and plastic products, key material in the fight against
          COVID-19. “We have advanced machinery that was going to sit idle, we
          have a workforce that was going to sit idle and we were able to put
          them to something that helps,” Mike Duggal, CEO Duggal Visual
          Solutions.

          As the virus continues to spread globally, the long term impacts on
          manufacturing remains an open-ended question.
