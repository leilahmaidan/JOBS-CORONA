          The manufacturing sector will experience a slump due to the impact of
          COVID-19. Of the Fortune 1000 companies surveyed by the American
          Chamber of Commerce Shanghai, 94% are experiencing disruption of their
          supply chain. As a result, impacted companies will not reach their
          2020 tier annual sales target and the effects will be seen in layoffs
          and reduced wages.

          According to the Institute for Supply Management’s Report On Business,
          an index that monitors monthly changes in manufacturer’s production
          levels, February’s backlog orders spiked by 4.6% from the previous
          month, the highest since April of last year. Even though the sector
          continued to experience a decrease in unemployment, it was not the
          case for durable goods, which was up by .4% from January.

          While China has begun to see a decrease in new coronavirus cases, the
          country is not back to normal. In a typical year, there would be a
          high spike in production before and after the Chinese New Year to
          offset the slow down or halt in production during the holiday. This
          year, that ramp up never happened.

          Qais Alkurdi, owner of SirCom, an American manufacturer of early
          warning systems, is three weeks behind on inventory deliveries.
          Approximately 70% of products that were supposed to arrive from
          Germany in the last week of February and first week of March, never
          came. The company still has no expected delivery date.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “Our supply chain has been disrupted in every possible scenario,
          including from shipping and deliveries. The UPS and DHLs of the world
          are acting similar to how you see them around Christmas time, they are
          doing what they can but being pushed and pulled in every direction.
          The delays are bad and there is no communication from our logistics
          partners. We expect deliveries one day, we get them the next,” said
          Alkurdi.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “The voting-eligible population makes it easier to make comparisons
          across states and across time because the way states manage registered
          voters differs quite a bit,” McDonald said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          SirCom, which assembles a majority of its product in Germany and the
          U.S., is experiencing disruption because it relies on key raw
          materials from China. The delays mean they will not reach their 2020
          projected profits, even with a recovery in the next 2-3 weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The company attempted to mitigate inventory gaps by seeking raw
          materials from other countries but were only successful in
          substituting 30% of the materials that came from China. With demand
          also coming from other manufacturers seeking alternatives, there was
          not enough supply.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Key materials required for lithium batteries and printed circuit
          boards, such as electronic circuitry, resistors and capacitors, were
          not easy to replace.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “We haven't yet been in a situation where we failed to meet [client]
          demand but we are at high risk, there is about a 65% chance we will
          not make our mid-April deadlines,” said Alkurdi.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          For Alkurdi’s company, if supply chain issues continued into
          mid-April, the outcome would be catastrophic. Large projects that had
          been awarded to them would fail to meet their dates and the impact
          could be felt in jobs.
