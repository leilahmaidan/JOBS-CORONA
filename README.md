### The global spread of coronavirus has left U.S. manufacturers standing in between a widening supply and demand fault line. The latest sign that companies are beginning to run into trouble. Of the Fortune 1000 companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce Shanghai, 94% are experiencing disruption of their supply chain due to COVID-19. As a result, impacted companies will not reach their 2020 tier annual sales target and the effects will be seen in layoffs and reduced wages.

## How to publish and submit your project

1. Make sure you have navigated to your `data-journalism` folder with your terminal first. Clone a fresh copy of this template.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:JOUR73351/google-sheets-project.git NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE
   ```

2. Remove my git tracking from the project

   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub called `NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE` with the following settings.

4. Run these git commands to initialize the repo. Make sure you've checked `ssh`.

   ```
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/YOUR-REPO-HERE.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

5. Write your pitch in `README.md`.

6. Write your story in and add your assets and charts to `index.html`. Feel free to play around with and change the styles in `style.css`, but you are not required to. Delete the code that you don't need for your story. The story itself should be no less than 150 words and include at least one chart from Datawrapper. You can embed a Datawrapper chart in your story by copying the embed code into your html as I have done in `index.html.`

   ```

   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

8. To save a version of your story on GitHub, run the following git commands.

   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "YOUR-COMMIT-MESSAGE-HERE"
   git push
   ```

9. To publish, go to the settings of your GitHub repo, scroll down to GitHub Pages, and configure the source to the master branch.
